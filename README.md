# encoding

the \n doesn't work but the rest works correctly

This is a easy and unsafe form of encryption.
Don't use this!!!

To encrypt a text:
1. write a text in input.txt
2. run the python file encoding.py
3. now you find your encoded text in the file output_encoded.txt

To decrypt a file:
1. write the encoded text in the file output_encoded.txt
2. run the python programm decoding.py
3. now you find your decoded text in the file output_decoded.txt

To generate a new key:
1. you must be sure that you have in key.txt in the first line letters or other symols for example: a|b|c|d|e...x|y|z|1|2|3...8|9|0
2. run key_generator.py
3. now there is in new_key.txt a new key
4. copy the key in the second line of key.txt to have a new random genrated key
